  Sales per region analysis:
</center>
</h3>
<p>

  The Impossible Burger was introduced in October 2018, which is the integral date
  to keep an eye on with these graphs. Let's start with looking at each region. For
  the most part, ever since October 2018, sales in every region have generally not
  gone back to the sales amount of October 2018. Aside from the Northwest USA,
  there hasn't been a single month where sales have sunk to or below the October
  2018 sales amount. Overall sales have been able to steadily increase and remain
  above that October 2018 dip in profits.

  Sales per item analysis:

</h3>

<p>

  &nbsp <center>
  Moving onto the graphs per item, the sales for each item over the past few months
  have been able to steadily recover. There are inevitably the routine ups and downs
  in sales as there have been even prior to the release of the Impossible Burger.
  If you look closely to these charts, you can see that sales never for each item
  never reached the amount of October 2018 again. This shows us that there is little
  need to worry about specific items --such as the hamburger-- from decreasing
  significantly in sales as its new competitor settles into the market.</center>

<h3><center> Key Takeaways </h3>

<p>

<ul>
  <li> Daily sales are important in order to visualize where things can be improved.
    In this case, it looks like sales are strongest for hamburgers generally on
    the weekends. </li>
  <li> Overall, the Impossible Burger did initially hit McDonalds sales hard.
    However, sales have been able to regain a footing and slowly increase again.
    The Impossible Burger hasn't had as significant of an impact that it would
    warrant further targeted action. </li>
  <li> In terms of future action, if you're continuing to look for more ways to
    be profitable, utilizing daily trends data would be the best place to start.
    Look for ways to increase sales during the week or focus more on the weekends
    and perhaps introduce some promotions or special deals that would drive
    even more customers into restaurants during the weekend. <i>Targeted action to
    respond to the Impossible Burger does not seem to be necessary.</i>
